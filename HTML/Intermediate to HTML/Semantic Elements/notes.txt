What are Semantic Elements?

- A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer

- Egs of nons-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

- Egs of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, <article>, <footer>, <header>, <main>.... - clearly defines its content.
