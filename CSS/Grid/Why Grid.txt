Dimensions define the primary demarcation between Flexbox and CSS Grid. Flexbox was designed specifically for one-dimensional layouts, while CSS Grid is engineered to enable two-dimensional layouts. Therefore, CSS Grid can easily render rows and columns simultaneously.


The Flexbox layout is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is designed for larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design.
