 With Flexbox all we need to do is to wrap your divs inside the container and set the display to Flexbox 
 Flexbox: displays the elements in hozirontal like a table

 .container{
    display: flex;                      means block flex
    gap: 1rem;
 }

    * We also have "inline-flex"
 **** When we use flexbox all the previous display will be ingored and be apply by flexbox. And the width of the box will normally based on the content size
